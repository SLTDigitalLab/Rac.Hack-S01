# Dataset 2: Insurance Data

## Dataset Description

The provided dataset, named "Insurance Data," contains information about insurance policy holders. The dataset includes several features that describe the characteristics of the policy holders.

## Columns

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- `age`: Age of the policy holder.
- `gender`: Gender of the policy holder.
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the policy holder.
- `children`: Number of children the policy holder has.
- `smoker`: Whether the policy holder is a smoker or not.
- `region`: Region where the policy holder resides.
- `medical_history`: Information about the policy holder's medical history.
- `family_medical_history`: Information about the policy holder's family medical history.
- `exercise_frequency`: Frequency of exercise for the policy holder.
- `occupation`: Occupation of the policy holder.
- `coverage_level`: Level of insurance coverage for the policy holder.
- `charges`: Insurance charges incurred by the policy holder.

## Task

The task is to create a model using the raccoon-ai engine to predict insurance charges based on the given features. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the model will learn patterns and relationships within the dataset to make accurate predictions on the charges incurred by policy holders.

Using the provided features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, medical history, family medical history, exercise frequency, occupation, and coverage level, the model will be trained to understand the impact of these factors on insurance charges. It will then generalize this knowledge to predict charges for new, unseen policy holders.

Note: Please ensure that you have access to the raccoon-ai engine and its documentation for more specific instructions and guidelines on how to utilize its functionalities to create the desired model.
